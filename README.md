This R package implements some Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian inference that require minimal tuning, including: 

* automated factor slice sampling (AFSS); 
* affine-invariant ensemble sampling (AIES); 
* No-U-Turn (NUTS) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; 
* and the MultiNest nested importance sampling algorithm.

Work in progress with AFSS as first stop in packaging...
